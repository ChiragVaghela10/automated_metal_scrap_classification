# Study of image preprocessing steps on scrap metal classification using object detection [Masters Thesis]
This repository contains the implementation of master's thesis project focused on automated metal scrap classification 
in railway containers. The solution leverages YOLOv5 model to identify and sort metal scrap materials from top-view 
container images.

## Introduction
This project aims at scrap metal classification using YOLOv5 algorithm.
